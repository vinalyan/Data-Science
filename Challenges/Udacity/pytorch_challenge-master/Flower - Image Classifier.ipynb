    "# Developing an AI application\n",
    "\n",
    "Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, you might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, you'd use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice you'd train this classifier, then export it for use in your application. We'll be using [this dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) of 102 flower categories, you can see a few examples below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='assets/Flowers.png' width=500px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is broken down into multiple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load and preprocess the image dataset\n",
    "* Train the image classifier on your dataset\n",
    "* Use the trained classifier to predict image content\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll lead you through each part which you'll implement in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you've completed this project, you'll have an application that can be trained on any set of labeled images. Here your network will be learning about flowers and end up as a command line application. But, what you do with your new skills depends on your imagination and effort in building a dataset. For example, imagine an app where you take a picture of a car, it tells you what the make and model is, then looks up information about it. Go build your own dataset and make something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "First up is importing the packages you'll need. It's good practice to keep all the imports at the beginning of your code. As you work through this notebook and find you need to import a package, make sure to add the import up here."

    "\n",
    "In [2] was explored the application of CNN for fower classification. The NN has five convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 79-way softmax. Their approach achieves 84.02% classification accuracy. One of the problems that they mentioned is related with the _intra-class variation_ and _inter-class similarity_. They mentioned that the dataset provided by Oxford is not good to deal more general situations, for the last reason they proposed a new dataset with 63,442 flower images. During their research they proposed a new region-based detection method for flower classificatio baed on combination of aaliency map and luminance map. Their framework has some steps to preprocessing the images into the template used in database:\n",
    "+ First, they crop out a maximum square patch from the resulting image generated by combining saliency map and luminance map, next, they down-sampled the images to a fixed resolution of 100, finally, they subtracted the mean RGB value, computed on the training set from each pixel.  \n",
    "+ They explained that flowers have high brithness and for that reason they converted each pixel from RGB color space to YUV color space to obain luminance and yhe Y component determines the brigthness of the color.\n",
    "The NN has the next architecture:\n",
    "+ The first convolutional layer filters the 100 x 100 x 3 input image with 64 kernels size 5 x 3 x 2. The second, third convolutional layers have 128, 256 kernels of size 5 x 5 x 64, 3 x 3 x 128 connected to the (normalized, pooled) outputs. The fourth convolutional layer has 512 kernels of size 3 x 3 x 256, adn the fifth convolutional layer has 512 kernels of size 3 x 3 x 512.\n",
    "+ The padding is 2 pixels for 5 x 5 convolutional layers and 1 pixel 3 x 3 convolutional layers\n",
    "+ The pooling layers have a stride of 2 and a kernel_size of 3\n",
    "+ The dropout has a rate of 0.5 and was used in the first two fully-connected layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "[3] is explored the application of transfer learning with a VGG 16 and the application of transversal convolution layers, this works has an accuracy more than 90%. \n",

You can [download the data here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/nd188/flower_data.zip). The dataset is split into two parts, training and validation. For the training, you'll want to apply transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping. This will help the network generalize leading to better performance. If you use a pre-trained network, you'll also need to make sure the input data is resized to 224x224 pixels as required by the networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "The pre-trained networks available from `torchvision` were trained on the ImageNet dataset where each color channel was normalized separately. For both sets you'll need to normalize the means and standard deviations of the images to what the network expects. For the means, it's `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and for the standard deviations `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`, calculated from the ImageNet images.  These values will shift each color channel to be centered at 0 and range from -1 to 1."

This is totally normal!\n",

Make sure to try different hyperparameters (learning rate, units in the classifier, epochs, etc) to find the best model. Save those hyperparameters to use as default values in the next part of the project."

You can reorder dimensions using [`ndarray.transpose`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.transpose.html).
