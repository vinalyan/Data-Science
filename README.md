## Introduction ##

My projects about applications of artificial intelligence to solve problems ☣


## Machine Learning ##

This folder has some projects and examples about Data Science , some of them were taken from some courses, 
such as Udacity and Coursera. Moreover, it has some codes to resolve some Kaggle competitions. 

In this you can find  since the application of Bagging algorithms until the use of Deep Learning algorithms. 

on the other hand, it has some presentations that I used in some classes related of Data Science.

## Artificial Intelligence 

This folder is focused to cover other areas from artificial intelligence, for example genetic programming 
and expert systems.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
This folder has some examples about the process to data mining, data visualization techniques through some 
examples and projects.
